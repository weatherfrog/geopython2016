GeoPython 2016 slides and code

## Instructions

Clone/download this repository. Then either

* open ``talk.slides.html`` (static slides) in a web browser, or
* Start ``jupyter-notebook`` and open the notebook ``talk.ipynb``. You'll need
  Python 3.4+ and up-to-date versions of jupyter, numpy, scipy, pandas,
  scikit-learn, cython, and h5py. The easiest way to get such an environment is
  by installing the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
  distribution.
